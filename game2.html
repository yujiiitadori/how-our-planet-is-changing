      <h1>Carbon Footprint</h1>
      <p>"Carbon Footprint" offers students a fun and engaging way to learn about the environmental impacts of everyday choices and explore practical strategies for reducing carbon emissions in their own lives.
</p>

	  <p> HOW TO PLAY<br>
Each player starts with a predetermined carbon footprint score and household resources.
<br>
Players take turns making decisions at different decision points, considering their options and the potential carbon emissions associated with each choice.


<br>
Players track their carbon footprint and resource usage throughout the game.


<br>
At the end of the game, players compare their carbon footprint scores and reflect on their choices and strategies.

<br>
Facilitate a discussion about the connections between individual actions, carbon emissions, and climate change, and explore real-world implications and opportunities for carbon reduction.

Facilitate a discussion about the connections between individual actions, carbon emissions, and climate change, and explore real-world implications and opportunities for carbon reduction.

	  <p>
	  Setup:<br>
Each player receives a virtual representation of a household or individual, along with an initial carbon footprint score based on their starting lifestyle choices.

   <br>
The game board represents different areas of daily life where players can make decisions affecting their carbon footprint, such as transportation, energy use, food consumption, and waste management.

<br><br><br>
Decision Points:
<br>
Players encounter decision points throughout the game where they must choose between different options with varying carbon footprints.

   <br>
For example, they may decide whether to walk, bike, drive, or take public transportation for their daily commute, or they may choose between energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy sources for their home.

   <br><br><br>

Resource Management:

<br>
Players manage resources such as energy, water, food, and waste, considering their environmental impacts and carbon emissions.

	<br>
They strive to minimize resource consumption and waste generation while maximizing efficiency and sustainability.

	<br><br><br>

Carbon Reduction Strategies:

<br>
Players explore and implement carbon reduction strategies, such as switching to renewable energy sources, adopting energy-efficient technologies, reducing meat consumption, recycling and composting, and supporting carbon offset projects.

<br>
They consider the environmental, social, and economic implications of their choices and strive for a balanced approach to reducing their carbon footprint.

<br><br><br>

Scoring and Feedback:

<br>
Players receive feedback on their carbon footprint and overall environmental impact based on their decisions and actions.

<br>
The game provides insights into the effectiveness of different strategies and encourages players to reflect on the connections between their lifestyle choices and climate change.
