      <h1>Global World Game: Climate Change Edition</h1>
      <p>"Global World Game: Climate Change Edition" provides students with an interactive and educational experience that fosters critical thinking, diplomatic skills, and a deeper understanding of the complexities of addressing climate change on a global scale.
</p>

	  <p> HOW TO PLAY
	  <br>
Assign roles to students and provide them with background information and resources.


	  <br>
Organize conference sessions focusing on different aspects of climate change.


<br>
Facilitate debate, negotiation, and resolution drafting among students.


<br>
Encourage collaboration and consensus-building among delegations.


<br>
Conduct voting on proposed resolutions and adopt them based on majority or consensus.


<br>
Reflect on the outcomes of the game and discuss lessons learned for real-world climate action.


	  </p>
      <h2>RULES</h2>
<p>
Role Assignment:

<br> 
Each student is assigned a specific role representing a country or stakeholder group.
<br>
Roles may include government representatives, scientists, environmental activists, industry leaders, and indigenous communities.


<br><br><br>

Preparation:


<br>
Before the game begins, students research their assigned roles and prepare position statements outlining their priorities, interests, and proposed solutions for addressing climate change.


<br>
They familiarize themselves with relevant scientific data, policy frameworks (such as the Paris Agreement), and negotiation strategies.


<br><br><br>

Conference Sessions:


<br>
The game consists of multiple conference sessions, each focusing on specific aspects of climate change (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions reduction, adaptation strategies, climate finance).


<br>
During each session, students engage in debate, discussions, and negotiations to draft resolutions addressing the designated topic.


<br><br><br>

Resolution Drafting:


<br>
Students collaborate within their delegations and across groups to draft resolutions that reflect their interests while also seeking common ground with other stakeholders.

<br><br><br>

Negotiation and Consensus Building:


<br>
Delegates engage in diplomatic negotiations to build support for their proposed resolutions and seek consensus among all participating countries and stakeholders.


<br>
They may form alliances, trade concessions, and make compromises to overcome disagreements and achieve collective goals.


<br><br><br>

Voting and Adoption:


<br>
Once resolutions are drafted and negotiated, delegates present them to the entire assembly for voting.


<br>
Resolutions require a majority or consensus vote for adoption, reflecting the level of support from all participating delegations.


<br><br><br>

Evaluation and Feedback:

<br>
Throughout the game, players receive feedback on their performance based on criteria such as response time, effectiveness of actions, casualty rates, and community resilience.

<br>
After the game, players reflect on their experiences, discuss lessons learned, and identify areas for improvement in disaster preparedness and response.

<br><br><br>
Implementation and Follow-Up:
<br>
After resolutions are adopted, students discuss strategies for implementing and monitoring their provisions in the real world.
<br>
They may consider follow-up actions, reporting mechanisms, and mechanisms for adjusting goals based on evolving scientific evidence and political dynamics.
