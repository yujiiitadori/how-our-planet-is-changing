Players manage resources such as renewable energy sources, fossil fuels, forests, water, and agricultural land.<br>
Balancing resource demand with environmental conservation and emissions reduction goals is essential for success.<br><br><br>

Technology Development:<br>
Players invest in research and development of clean technologies such as renewable energy systems, energy-efficient transportation, and carbon capture and storage.<br>
Consider factors like cost, efficiency, scalability, and public acceptance of new technologies.<br><br><br>

Policy Decisions:<br>
Players enact policies and regulations to incentivize sustainable practices and discourage carbon-intensive activities.<br>
Policies may include carbon pricing mechanisms, renewable energy mandates, emissions standards, conservation incentives, and international agreements.<br><br><br>
